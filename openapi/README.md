# API
Contains an OpenAPI v3 specification for the TriReg2 service.

## Module structure

* The root yaml source files are split into the **user API** [trireg2user.yaml](trireg2user.yaml) and the **admin API**  [trireg2admin.yaml](trireg2admin.yaml)
* 
* We split the definitions into multiple files to prevent the root files from becoming too large and hard to maintain.
