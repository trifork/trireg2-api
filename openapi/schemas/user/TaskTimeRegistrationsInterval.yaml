description: |
  The time registrations for some specific task. These are grouped by the days in the search interval, where the
  registrations for each day can be empty. For example: lets assume a user has performed two differently tagged time 
  registrations on Monday and one time registration on Wednesday in some week. If that week is queried, then the
  response will contain an entry with the task, and an array of 'dailyRegistration' with seven entries (Monday-Sunday).
  The Monday entry will contain two time registrations, the Wednesday entry will contain the single time registration, 
  and the remaining five days will contain empty arrays.
