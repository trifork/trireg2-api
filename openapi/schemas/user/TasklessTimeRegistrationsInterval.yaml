required: ["taskDescription", "dailyRegistrations"]
description: |
  Time registrations without a task association. These are grouped by description and subsequently days in the search
  interval, where the registrations for each day can be empty. For example: lets assume a user has performed a taskless
  time registration with comment "Working on the Project" on Tuesday and one time registration with the same comment on
  Thursday in some week. If that week is queried, then the response will contain an entry with 'taskDescription' = 
  "Working on the Project", and an array of 'dailyRegistration' with seven entries (Monday-Sunday). The Tuesday and
  Thursday entries will contain one time registration, and the remaining five days will contain empty arrays.
